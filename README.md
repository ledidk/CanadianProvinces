**My Canada Page Project**

Description:

Welcome to My Canada Project Page! 

It is a web project that provides information about Canadian provinces in both English and French. You can explore the names of Canadian provinces and learn more about each province by clicking on them. The project aims to showcase basic web development skills and offers bilingual content for a better user experience.

Features:
1. Bilingual Content: The page can be viewed in English and French. You can easily switch between the two languages by clicking on the "Français" or "English" links at the top right.

2. Province List: You can see a list of Canadian provinces. The names of provinces will change based on the language you choose.

3. Province Details: Clicking on a province name will show you more information about that specific province. The details are also available in both English and French.

4. Navigation: At the top is a simple menu to move between the "Home" and "Provinces" sections.

5. Responsive Design: The page is designed to work well on different devices, including mobile phones and tablets.

6. Social Media Links: At the bottom of the page, you can find links to my LinkedIn, GitHub, and Instagram profiles.

How to Use:
1. Access the Page: You can visit the web page by using any web browser. Just type the website address or download the project and open the `index.html` file on your computer.

2. Toggle Language: To change the language, click on "Français" for French or "English" for English at the top right.

3. Explore Provinces: Click on "Provinces" in the menu to see the list of Canadian provinces. Click on any province to read more about it.

Future Plans:
I'm continuously working on this project to make it even better! Soon, the page will display real-time data and have more exciting content for you to explore.
